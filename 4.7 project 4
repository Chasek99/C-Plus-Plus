1.Lots of things would be difficult to program without loops, like food menus, for example in the delgados tacos we made it into a loop.
if we didn't the user could only order one thing. 


2.A advantage of a switch statement is that it can handle multiple selctions of numbers by passing control to the next switch statement. 
Some disadvantages are that it can only handle intergers or a char as a variable.You can also not use logical operators.


3. A for loop is used to repeat a certin block of code a set number of times. A while loop is used when the number of times we want to 
run the block of code is not known. So you should use a while loop over a for loop when your asking a user what they want to order. 
You wont know how much food that person might order so you use a while loop to continue to ask until they finsh their order. 


4.My favorite game with a loop would have to be pac-man, the loop works by when you run out of lives it ask if you to play the game again.
If you say yes the it runs through the game code again.
